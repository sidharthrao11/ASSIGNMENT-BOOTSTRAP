    <h2>Q.1 What are the advantages of Bootstrap? <br></h2>
    <h3>Ans:- Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, offers several advantages:- <br><br>
        
        1.Rapid Development: Bootstrap provides pre-styled components and a grid system, allowing developers to quickly <br>
        build responsive and visually appealing websites without spending time on writing CSS from scratch. <br><br>
        
        2.Responsiveness: Bootstrap's grid system ensures that websites built with it are responsive and adapt well to different <br>
        screen sizes and devices, reducing the need for separate designs for desktop and mobile. <br><br>
        
        3.Consistency: Bootstrap's extensive library of components ensures consistency in design across the entire website. <br>
         This consistency leads to a better user experience as users navigate through different pages. <br><br>
        
        4.Customization: While Bootstrap comes with a default set of styles and components, it's highly customizable. <br>
        Developers can easily override the default styles to match the specific design requirements of their project. <br><br>
        
        5.Cross-browser Compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to be compatible with all major browsers, ensuring a consistent <br>
         experience for users regardless of the browser they use. <br><br>
